# My Personal Project ------ Money Control

### Producer: Yuxuan (Lyka) Wang
### Date: Oct12, 2021

___
This project is designed to **help people keep track of their financial outcome**. It is suitable for 
**everyone**, especially for those who do not have money left at the end of each month due to a lack of money planning. 
It interests me because I am this type of people sometimes. I usually feel curious about my bill and ask, "*Was this 
all really me?*". I suspect I am not the only one who feels this way! Its purpose is to **assist people like me in 
remembering where our money goes, and to manage it more effectively**.

___
It has some **basic functions**:
- Payments can be recorded with dates and categories in this application;
- This application is able to check the amount of spending per month;
- This application is able to check the amount of spending with different category;
- People who are interested in controlling their spending can enter their expected monthly spending amount and the 
system will monitor it, alerting them if it exceeds the amount.

### Phase 4: Task 3
I like my project because I think it is useful. However, if I have more time, I hope I could improve it on the 
following aspects:
- For the add a bill function, I hope I can input all the information at one pop up window instead of need to input 
one by one.
- I should add a function that user could change some information of one bill directly.
- I should move the all bills table to the main window so that after I do add or delete, I can see the changes 
immediately.
- I should add the set alert value as well as the expense on the most recent month at the main window, maybe a change 
set alert value button should be added to the main window too.
